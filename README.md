# Sujet : Pipotron - Programme de génération de phrases

## Partie I - Pipotron

In this section, you are asked to create a Java program capable of reading the rule and phrase portion files provided in the project archive and use them to generate sentences automatically.

The program must:

- Read the provided files
- Select a rule at random and apply it to generate a sentence
- Repeat the operation until the desired number of sentences is reached

Two source code examples are provided: FileReaderExample.java and XmlReaderExample.java.

## Partie II - Interactive Pipotron

Once Part I is completed, an additional step is required after generating each sentence. This step allows the user to view the result and request a partial rewrite if necessary.

The user can:

- View the generated sentence
- Request the regeneration of a portion of the sentence by indicating the associated number
- Enter 0 to validate the sentence and move on to generating the next sentence

It is also possible to add a feature allowing the user to directly rewrite a portion of the sentence.

## Consignes et contraintes d'implémentation

Before implementation, it is necessary to model the program in UML and apply the diagram during implementation. The correspondence between modeling and implementation will be verified.
